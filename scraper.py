Single place that pulls OTC candles from the upstream source used for EURUSD_OTC,
now generalized for ANY <AAABBB>_OTC.

We keep it async + httpx so it runs fine on Render without a browser.
If your current working upstream code for EURUSD_OTC used a different client,
just plug it inside `_fetch_raw_candles` and keep the function signature.
